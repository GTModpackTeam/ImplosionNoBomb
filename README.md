<h1 align="center">Implosion No Bomb</h1>

## Info
1. Implosion No Bomb (INB) is a simple mod that modifies GCYM's Electric Implosion Compressor so that it does not require explosives, like gregicality-legacy.
2. (_For addon-creator_) Added a useful RecipeMap called `FAKE_IMPLOSION_RECIPES`. This RecipeMap allows you to register recipes for all four explosives.
